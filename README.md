# Simple Wordpress DEV environment with docker compose

I needed a quick way to get a WordPress instance up and running locally. 

I tried a few alternatives, nd they were all either too complicated or just didn't work when I followed the README, so here is my approach.

**Warning**:
This approach is **only for local dev**. It is not secure, and you should not use it for Production anywhere. You have been warned.

## How  does this work 

There are 3 important files:

1. `docker-compose.yml`: here is where everything happens. It basically does the following:
   - gets the latest versions of the official containers for WordPress, MariaDB, PHPMyAdmin and WP-CLI.
   - creates a database with name  `wordpress`, user and password `root`.
   - creates a WordPress instance with that database.
2. `setup.sh`: this is mostly for comfort. It does the following:
   - checks if you have an old `docker-compose` or a new `docker compose` version and uses it.
   - sets UID and GID ENV Vars with yours, and adds them to the `.env` file. 
     - [ ] I'm still playing with this. The idea was to use the same local UID and GID for the container, but if I do that the container cannot use the folder. I just defaulted to chmod 777.
3. `start.sh`: creates the directory for WordPress, sets permissions to 777 (I told you this is not secure) and starts docker compose.
4. `docker_aliases`: this is autogenerated when you run either `setup.sh` or `start.sh`. Then you can `source ./docker_aliases` to get the following aliases:
   - `dc` for docker compose in the version that you have
   - `wpcli` for 

## How to use

```shell
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

## How to use the aliases

## `dc`

```shell
# Bring up the services
dc up -d

# Stop the services
dc down

# Stop the services and remove volumes
dc down -v

# View the status of the services
dc ps
```

## Uninstall/ Remove

If you don't need this anymore, just remove the containers and volumes, and remove the folders.

```shell

```
